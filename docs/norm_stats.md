# Normalization statistics

Published checkpoints store the normalization statistics used for policy inference. This inference-only fork loads those assets automatically and does not compute new statistics or fine-tune models. See the [original OpenPI repository](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi) for training workflows.


## Provided Pre-training Normalization Statistics

Below is a list of all the pre-training normalization statistics we provide. We provide them for both, the `pi0_base` and `pi0_fast_base` models. For `pi0_base`, set the `assets_dir` to `gs://openpi-assets/checkpoints/pi0_base/assets` and for `pi0_fast_base`, set the `assets_dir` to `gs://openpi-assets/checkpoints/pi0_fast_base/assets`.
| Robot | Description | Asset ID |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| ALOHA | 6-DoF dual arm robot with parallel grippers | trossen |
| Mobile ALOHA | Mobile version of ALOHA mounted on a Slate base | trossen_mobile |
| Franka Emika (DROID) | 7-DoF arm with parallel gripper based on the DROID setup | droid |
| Franka Emika (non-DROID) | Franka FR3 arm with Robotiq 2F-85 gripper | franka |
| UR5e | 6-DoF UR5e arm with Robotiq 2F-85 gripper | ur5e |
| UR5e bi-manual | Bi-manual UR5e setup with Robotiq 2F-85 grippers | ur5e_dual |
| ARX | Bi-manual ARX-5 robot arm setup with parallel gripper | arx |
| ARX mobile | Mobile version of bi-manual ARX-5 robot arm setup mounted on a Slate base | arx_mobile |
| Fibocom mobile | Fibocom mobile robot with 2x ARX-5 arms | fibocom_mobile |


## Pi0 Model Action Space Definitions

Out of the box, both the `pi0_base` and `pi0_fast_base` use the following action space definitions (left and right are defined looking from behind the robot towards the workspace):
```
    "dim_0:dim_5": "left arm joint angles",
    "dim_6": "left arm gripper position",
    "dim_7:dim_12": "right arm joint angles (for bi-manual only)",
    "dim_13": "right arm gripper position (for bi-manual only)",

    # For mobile robots:
    "dim_14:dim_15": "x-y base velocity (for mobile robots only)",
```

The proprioceptive state uses the same definitions as the action space, except for the base x-y position (the last two dimensions) for mobile robots, which we don't include in the proprioceptive state.

For 7-DoF robots (e.g. Franka), we use the first 7 dimensions of the action space for the joint actions, and the 8th dimension for the gripper action.

General info for Pi robots:
- Joint angles are expressed in radians, with position zero corresponding to the zero position reported by each robot's interface library, except for ALOHA, where the standard ALOHA code uses a slightly different convention (see the [ALOHA example code](../examples/aloha_real/README.md) for details).
- Gripper positions are in [0.0, 1.0], with 0.0 corresponding to fully open and 1.0 corresponding to fully closed.
- Control frequencies are either 20 Hz for UR5e and Franka, and 50 Hz for ARX and Trossen (ALOHA) arms.

For DROID, we use the original DROID action configuration, with joint velocity actions in the first 7 dimensions and gripper actions in the 8th dimension + a control frequency of 15 Hz.
